		Major pieces of the web: Browser -> Internet -> HTTP Request to Server -> The the same in reverse

				HTML - Hypertext markup language, main web doc type:
						<ul>
						<li>
						Heart of the web
						 </li>
						 <li>Made up of text content - <em>what you see</em>
						 </li>
						 <li>Markup - <em>what it looks like</em>	
						 </li>
						 <li>Can include references to - images, videos etc
						 </li>
						 <li>Other docs
						 </li>
						 <li>Links
						 </li>
						</ul>
				<p>
				HTML Markup - made up of tags such as b for bold, em for emphasis or italics.

				Image tags (img) do not include a closing tag, these are called <b>void tags</b>.  Good coding calls for alternate text to be provided for images as well.				
				</p>
					<p>
						HTML elements are either <em>inline</em>, or <em>block</em>.  Block elements form an invisible box around the content inside them.  Examples of inline
						elements are b, img or span.  P, div and others are examples of block elements.

					</p>

						<p>
						HTML attributes are part of HTML elements, for example using the href attribute to provide the URL
						in an anchor tag.
						</p>

						Example: <a href="http://www.google.com">Link to Google</a>

		<h2>Lesson 2: Adding Structure to HTML Docs</h2>
			<div class=LessonTopics>		
				<ul>
					<li>
					HTML and CSS are both languages
					</li>
					<li>HTML controls the "structure" of a web page
					</li>
					<li>CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks). Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
					</li>
					<li>When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.  The tree structure allows elements to have other elements inside of them.
					</li>
					<li>Structure is important when coding your HTML documents as it allows for easy review of your work.  An example of this would be to add a logical structure, such as a setting up one a set of styles that can be easily reused for your purpose.  Time is saved for everyone - the person coding and the end user who will get a page to load more quickly.
					</li>
					<li>
					 Properly nested code will have identantions which will go deeper and deeper the more nexted they are within their box.
					</li>
					<li>Inspecting elements and developer tools in your browser can be a huge time saver for troubleshooting and design direction.
					 </li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS to HTML</h2>
			<div class=LessonTopics>		
				<ul>
					<li>
					CSS code will allow you to process repeated formatting quickly and easily.  It can be applied to the entire sheet, an identified class or even elements.
					</li>
					<li>HTML controls the "structure" of a web page
					</li>
					<li>CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks). Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although you can apple style directly in your HTML doc, that is only recommended for very short lines of code.  A standalone CSS file is the best route.
					</li>
					<li>The item you will be "styling" is called a "selector".  The <em>declation</em>is what you are modifying (font size, color) to which value (for example red font, size 12). The following website provides reference materials on this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Guide</a>
					</li>
					<li>CSS works by applying a major rule when it comes to "cascading".  It is a rule of inheritance - it basically states that properties assigned to a specific element will not only apply to the specified element, but also to it's descendants. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Inheritance">This website explains the rule in detail</a>
					</li>
					<li>
					<em>Flexbox</em> allows for easily manipulation of boxes for alignment.  <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">This site provides the ins and outs of how it works</a>
					</li>
					<li>Always keep in mind the 4 box componenets (margin, border, padding and content).  Sizing by percentage is almost always a better bet than pixels to help account for varied resolutions.
					 </li>
					<li>When coding, look for natural boxes, repeated styles/semantic elements, write the HTML, apply styles(from biggest to smallest) and then fix things.  Repeat 3-5 as neccesary.
